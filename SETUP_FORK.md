# Fork Setup - Already Complete! ✅

Your fork is already set up and connected to upstream. This file documents what was done.

## ✅ Current Configuration

- **Local Repository:** C:\Users\mehdi\OneDrive\Documents\Skua\Scripts
- **Your Fork (origin):** https://github.com/MehdiMamas/Scripts-Skua.git
- **Upstream Source:** https://github.com/BrenoHenrike/Scripts.git
- **Tracking Branch:** upstream/Skua (NOT master!)

## ✅ What's Been Configured

1. ✅ Git repository initialized
2. ✅ Origin remote points to your fork
3. ✅ Upstream remote points to BrenoHenrike/Scripts
4. ✅ Tracking upstream/Skua branch (correct branch for scripts)
5. ✅ Custom modifications committed
6. ✅ Pushed to your GitHub fork

## Verify Setup

Run this to verify everything is correct:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\mehdi\OneDrive\Documents\Skua\Scripts"

# Check remotes
git remote -v

# Check current branch
git branch

# Check connection to upstream/Skua
git fetch upstream
git log HEAD..upstream/Skua --oneline -5
```

## Next Steps

Since setup is complete, refer to:

- **QUICK_START.md** - How to check for updates
- **FORK_WORKFLOW.md** - How to manage your fork
- **AGENT.md** - Debugging and development guide

## Important Notes

- ⚠️ Track **upstream/Skua** branch, NOT upstream/master
- ⚠️ Master branch is outdated/different - always use Skua branch
- ✅ Your custom changes are on top of upstream/Skua
- ✅ Update scripts are configured for Skua branch

---

**You're ready to go!** Just use the update scripts to stay current.
